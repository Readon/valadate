Description: Unit testing framework for GObject-based code - runner
 Valadate is a unit testing framework based on GLib Testing. It is primarily
 intended for testing code written in Vala, but can be used with any
 GObject-based code.
 .
 This package contains runner that automatically discovers test cases in
 a shared library using .vapi (generated by vala) or .gir (generated by
 g-ir-scanner from gobject-introspection) metadata file.
 .
 The gobject-introspection and gobject-introspection-glib-2.0 packages are
 needed if you intend to use .gir files. Using .vapi files generated by valac
 should work without (but obviously requires valac).
