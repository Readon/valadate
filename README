Valadate
========

Valadate is a unit testing framework based on GLib Testing. It is primarily
intended for testing code written in [Vala][vala], but can be used with any
GObject-based code.

Features
--------

  * Automatic test discovery like JUnit or .NET testing framework.
    
    Tests can be automatically found in a shared library using either
    .vapi ([Vala][vala] API description) or [.gir][gir] file.

  * Running tests for all parameters from specific set.

    A test fixture can define properties and sets of values for them and the
    discovered test methods will automatically be run for all of them.

  * Utility functions for waiting in a main loop until specified event or
    timeout occurs.

  * Support for asynchronous tests. Method declared async in vala will be
    automatically run under main loop until completion or configurable
    timeout.

Planned features
----------------

  * Utility functions providing temporary directory to tests.

    With support for initializing the temporary directory by storing data
    defined by simple declaration, copying specified files there, extracting
    an archive and running a shell snippet.

  * Automatically running all or selected tests in child processes via
    g_test_trap_fork.

  * Generic tests.

    Support for providing a list of types a generic test fixture should be
    instantiated for. 

Dependencies
------------

  * [GLib][glib] 2.20.0 or later
  * [Vala][vala] 0.7.7 or later
  * [GOjbect-introspection][gir] 0.6.5 or later
  * [Python][python] (for compilation only) 2.3 or later
